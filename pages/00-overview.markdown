KeepTruckin makes it easy for you to access all of your fleet management data, so you can take advantage of the powerful data collection technology in the KeepTruckin ELD and mobile apps.

This document describes how to interact with our APIs. Our APIs will allow you to get data for reports, make changes to your fleet, integrate with Transportation Management Systems (TMS), and build dashboards outside of KeepTruckin to help you understand your business as a whole. Our APIs are secured with HTTPS and will provide JSON or XML formatted responses.
